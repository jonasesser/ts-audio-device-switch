# Teufelswerk's Audio Device Switch [ts-audio-device-switch]

This Teamspeak 3 plugin adds a new Option to switch the audio device for a specific user. The idea was born on the roleplay GTA V server StateV. Where a small group of outlaws teamed up with the Teufel company (Ingame) to work together to counter music copyright issues.

**[Update: 18.12.2020 First functional prototype. Busy to create documentation, stay tuned!]**

## Idea

A Option to switch the audio device for a specific user by right click on the user name.
Use case example: In some games users will play copyright protected music. With this feature for example a streamer can split these audio streams into another. Then its possible to hear the music but not record or stream them.
